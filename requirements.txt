The list of the required modules:

1. TensorFlow and Keras:

	tensorflow: TensorFlow is the core library for building deep learning models.
	keras: Keras is a high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow.

2. NumPy:

	numpy: NumPy is used for numerical operations and array manipulation.

3. Data Visualization:

	matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating visualizations.


4. PIL or Pillow: The Python Imaging Library (PIL) or its fork Pillow is used for image processing.


5. opencv-python: OpenCV is often used for image preprocessing and augmentation.

6. Additional Utilities:

	scikit-learn: Scikit-learn provides utilities for data preprocessing and evaluation.

7. jupyter: If you prefer using Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development.

Optional: GPU Support (If available):

tensorflow-gpu: If you have a compatible GPU and want to accelerate training.

Optional: tqdm (for progress bars during training):

tqdm: Provides a fast, extensible progress bar for loops and pipelines.
